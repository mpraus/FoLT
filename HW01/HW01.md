The most challenging tasks in NLP are ones that require reasoning and a deep understanding of language. Due to the ambiguity of language, it is difficult for computers to accurately determine the meaning of words/sentences. As a result, tasks such as grammar checkers[^1], machine translation[^1], speech recognition[^2], or argument mining[^3] are very difficult. With regard to speech recognition, the very varied use of a language (speed, speech impediments, slang, dialects, etc.) further complicates this task.

NLP has also progressed in areas such as statistical decipherment of dead languages [^4], which is a difficult task for humans as well as machines as it not only requires the understanding of human language but also very specific domain knowledge[^5].
