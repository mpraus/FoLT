The most challenging tasks in NLP are ones that require reasoning and a deep understanding of language. Due to the ambiguity of language, it is difficult for computers to accurately determine the meaning of words/sentences. As a result, tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, or argument mining are very difficult. With regard to speech recogniation, the very varied use of a language (speed, speech impediments, slang, dialects, etc.) further complicates this task.
