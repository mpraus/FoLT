    "into its component pieces, for example losses might be broken down as loss + es. In English, morphology is relatively\n",
    "simple and is mostly comprised of prefixes and suffixes. To get an idea of what suffixes are common in English (and\n",
    "thus could be morphemes), we can look at the frequencies of the last two characters of sufficiently long words. Write\n",
    "a function ***top_suffixes(words)*** that takes a sequence of words as an input and returns the ***20 most frequent twocharacter suffixes*** of the input words. We define a two-character suffix as the last two characters of any word of ***length\n",
    "5*** or more, thus your function may simply ignore any word shorter than five characters. Your function should use the\n",
